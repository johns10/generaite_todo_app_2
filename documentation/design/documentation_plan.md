## To-Do App Documentation Plan

1. Overview

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to documenting the To-Do App, with a focus on clarity, completeness, and machine-readability to facilitate LLM-assisted development.

2. Documentation Components

README.md
API Documentation
Architecture Overview
Interface Definitions
Code Comments
Examples and Tutorials
Change Log
Contributing Guide

3. Documentation Standards

Use clear, concise language
Maintain consistent formatting
Provide code examples where applicable
Use links to connect related documentation
Keep documentation close to the code it describes
Update documentation with every code change

4. README.md

Project overview
Quick start guide
Dependencies and installation instructions
Basic usage examples
Links to detailed documentation

5. API Documentation

Use cargo doc to generate API documentation
Document all public items (functions, structs, traits, etc.)
Include usage examples for complex items
Clearly state parameter types and return values
Describe error conditions and handling

6. Architecture Overview

High-level system design diagram
Description of major components and their interactions
Data flow diagrams
Design patterns used

7. Interface Definitions

Document all traits (interfaces) in detail
Explain the purpose of each trait method
Provide usage examples for each trait
Describe expected implementations

8. Code Comments

Use /// for documentation comments
Annotate complex algorithms with inline comments
Use //! for module-level documentation
Include # Examples sections in doc comments

13. LLM-Focused Documentation

Use consistent terminology throughout
Provide context and rationale for design decisions
Include metadata tags for easy searching
Create a glossary of domain-specific terms
