LLM Testing Strategy: Aider and Cargo-watch Integration
1. Overview
This strategy outlines an automated testing approach for validating changes made by the Aider AI coding assistant before committing them to the codebase. It uses cargo-watch to continuously monitor for changes and trigger the testing pipeline.
2. Components

Aider for AI-assisted code generation and modification
Cargo-watch for file system monitoring
Testing Pipeline
Version Control Integration
Reporting and Logging

3. Workflow

Developer initiates Aider session
Aider generates or modifies code based on prompts
Cargo-watch detects changes
Testing Pipeline is triggered
If tests pass, changes are ready for review and commit
If tests fail, developer is notified to make corrections

4. Detailed Strategy
4.1 Aider Setup

Install Aider: pip install aider-chat
Configure Aider to work with your project directory
Use Aider's chat interface for code generation and modification

4.2 Cargo-watch Setup

Install cargo-watch: cargo install cargo-watch
Run cargo-watch to monitor project directory:
Copycargo watch -x check -x test -x 'run --bin test_runner'


4.3 Testing Pipeline

Static Analysis

Run clippy for linting
Check code formatting with rustfmt


Unit Tests

Run all unit tests


Integration Tests

Run integration tests that cover critical paths


Custom Test Runner

Implement a custom binary test_runner for additional tests or checks
