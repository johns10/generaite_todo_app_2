# To-Do App Code Standards

## 1. High Modularity
- Break the application into small, focused modules.
- Each module should have a single responsibility.
- Use a clear directory structure that reflects the application's architecture.
- Aim for high cohesion within modules and loose coupling between modules.

## 2. Strict Segregation of Responsibility
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle rigorously.
- Separate concerns: keep business logic, data access, and presentation logic in different modules.
- Use dependency injection to manage dependencies between components.

## 3. Small File Sizes
- Aim for files no larger than 200 lines of code.
- If a file grows beyond this, consider splitting it into multiple files.
- Each file should contain only one primary struct or enum and its associated implementations.

## 4. Typing
- Use strong typing throughout the application.
- Leverage Rust's type system to prevent errors at compile-time.
- Use generics and traits to write flexible, reusable code.
- Avoid `unwrap()` and `expect()` in production code; use proper error handling instead.

## 5. Heavy Use of Interfaces
- Define traits for all major components (e.g., repositories, services).
- Implement these traits for concrete types.
- Use trait objects to allow for easy swapping of implementations and to facilitate testing.

## 6. High Focus on Testability
- Write unit tests for all public functions and methods.
- Use dependency injection to make components easily testable.
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage.
- Write integration tests for critical paths in the application.
- Use mock objects for external dependencies in unit tests.

## 7. Consistent Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for functions, methods, variables, and modules.
- Use PascalCase for types (structs, enums, traits).
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Use descriptive, meaningful names that convey purpose.
- Prefix interface traits with 'I' (e.g., `ITaskRepository`).

## 8. Function/Method Descriptions
- Use doc comments (`///`) for all public functions and methods.
- Include a brief description, parameters, return values, and examples in doc comments.
- For complex functions, include a "Details" section explaining the algorithm or approach.

## 9. Inline Comments
- Use inline comments sparingly, preferring self-documenting code.
- When used, inline comments should explain "why", not "what" or "how".
- Keep inline comments up-to-date with code changes.

## 10. Design Patterns
- Use the Repository pattern for data access.
- Implement the Service Layer pattern for business logic.
- Use the Strategy pattern for interchangeable algorithms.
- Apply the Builder pattern for complex object construction.
- Utilize the Observer pattern for event handling.

## 11. Error Handling
- Define custom error types for each module.
- Use the `Result` type for operations that can fail.
- Propagate errors up the call stack using the `?` operator.
- Provide context when wrapping errors (e.g., using `anyhow::Context`).
- Log errors at appropriate levels (debug, info, warn, error).

## 12. Configuration Management
- Use a configuration file (e.g., YAML or TOML) for all configurable parameters.
- Implement a `Config` struct to hold configuration values.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., database credentials).
- Validate configuration at startup.

## 13. Code Style
- Follow the Rust style guide (https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).
- Use `rustfmt` to automatically format code.
- Use `clippy` to catch common mistakes and non-idiomatic code.
- Limit line length to 100 characters.
- Use meaningful whitespace to improve readability.

## 14. Version Control
- Use Git for version control.
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Use feature branches for new development.
- Perform code reviews before merging into the main branch.

## 15. Documentation
- Maintain a README.md file with project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples.
- Use cargo-doc to generate API documentation.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.

Remember to review and update these standards periodically as the project evolves and new best practices emerge.
