+Based on the project's architecture, tech stack, and configuration requirements outlined in the design documents, create a .env.example file with placeholders for all relevant variables. Include variables for the following categories:
+
+Environment specification (development, test, production)
+Database configuration:
+
+Host, port, name, user, password for PostgreSQL
+Connection pool size for production
+
+
+Server configuration:
+
+Host and port
+
+
+JWT configuration:
+
+Secret and expiration time
+
+
+Logging configuration:
+
+Log level for different environments
+
+
+Rate limiting settings:
+
+Number of requests and duration
+
+
+Frontend URL
+Feature flags:
+
+enable_feature_x
+
+
+Sentry DSN for production error tracking
+
+Ensure that the .env.example file covers all necessary configurations for development, test, and production environments. Use descriptive variable names and provide comments for each variable to explain its purpose. Include any additional environment variables that might be required based on the project's dependencies listed in the Cargo.toml file.
+Format the .env.example file with clear sections for each category of configuration, and use placeholder values that indicate the expected format or range of values for each variable."
+This prompt covers the main aspects of the project's configuration needs based on the information available in the design documents and Cargo.toml file. It ensures that the resulting .env.example file will be comprehensive and adaptable to different environments.

+Refactor main.rs so that it has a function called hello_world, which returns "Hello, World!", and that main calls print on that function.

# 2024-08-20 23:21:32.181156
+Refactor main.rs so that it has a function called initial_message, which returns "Starting Todo App", and that main calls print on that function.
+Create a main test file that tests the initial_message function from main.rs, and asserts that it returns "Starting Todo App"

+https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html https://docs.rs/config/latest/config/ Create a src/config.rs file and implement a Config struct for our Todo application. The configuration system should:
+
+1. Use the `config` crate to manage hierarchical configuration.
+2. Load configuration from the following sources, in order of priority:
+   a. Environment variables (highest priority)
+   b. A config file specific to the current environment (development, test, production)
+   c. A default config file
+
+3. Include the following configuration sections:
+   - Database: connection details (host, port, name, user, password)
+   - Server: host and port
+   - JWT: secret and expiration time
+   - Logging: log level
+   - Rate limiting: requests per duration
+   - Feature flags
+
+4. Use environment variables wherever possible, following the CARGO_* naming convention.
+
+5. Implement a `Config::load()` function that returns a Result<Config, ConfigError>.
+
+6. Follow the code standards outlined in code_standards.md, particularly:
+   - Use strong typing throughout the application
+   - Write clear documentation comments for the Config struct and its methods
+   - Implement proper error handling
+
+7. Ensure the configuration can be easily accessed throughout the application.
+
+8. Add a `version` field to the Config struct and populate it from Cargo.toml.
+
+Here's a skeleton to get you started:
+
+```rust
+use config::{Config as ConfigRs, ConfigError, Environment, File};
+use serde::Deserialize;
+use std::env;
+
+#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
+pub struct Config {
+    pub version: String,
+    pub database: DatabaseConfig,
+    pub server: ServerConfig,
+    pub jwt: JwtConfig,
+    pub logging: LoggingConfig,
+    pub rate_limiting: RateLimitingConfig,
+    pub feature_flags: FeatureFlags,
+}
+
+// Implement sub-structs for each configuration section
+
+impl Config {
+    pub fn load() -> Result<Self, ConfigError> {
+        // Implement configuration loading logic here
+    }
+}

+Thank you for providing the additional information. Now I have a better understanding of the project structure and requirements. Based on the provided files and the tech stack document, I'll create a prompt for implementing the CLI module. Here's the list of relevant files:
+aider src/main.rs src/config.rs Cargo.toml design/tech_stack.md
+Now, I'll create the prompt for implementing the CLI module:
+Create a CLI module for the gen_todo application using the following guidelines:
+
+Use the clap crate (version 4.5.16) for building the command-line interface.
+Create a new file src/cli.rs to contain the CLI-related code.
+In src/cli.rs, implement the following:
+a. A function build_cli() that returns a clap::Command structure defining the CLI.
+b. A function run_cli(config: &Config) that handles the CLI logic.
+Add a "version" subcommand that prints the application version.
+In src/main.rs:
+a. Add a mod cli; declaration at the top of the file.
+b. Modify the main() function to:
+
+Load the configuration using Config::load().
+Build the CLI using cli::build_cli().
+Parse the command-line arguments.
+Call cli::run_cli() with the parsed arguments and configuration.
+
+
+Ensure that the version information is retrieved from the Config struct, which already contains the version from Cargo.toml.
+Follow the code standards outlined in the project, including:
+
+Use snake_case for functions and variables.
+Add appropriate documentation comments for public functions.
+Implement error handling using Result where appropriate.
+
+
+Update Cargo.toml to ensure the clap dependency is correctly specified with any necessary features.
+
+Please implement this CLI module, ensuring it integrates well with the existing project structure and follows the established coding standards.
